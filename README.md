Abstract
--------
Many astronomical projects, from large (think *Gaia* and *LSST*)
to small (think individual investigators with a few nights at NOAO)
face substantial data distribution, backup, and preservation issues:  These
operations are not inexpensive, and they involve uncontrolled costs
into the future.  Here we propose (and implement, in a limited way) a
fully distributed astronomical sharing system built on *BitTorrent*.
Crucially we add to the ordinary chaos of torrents (with which we do not
want to interfere) some participation conditions for registered, trusted users
to maintain provenance for users with strong provenance demands.
